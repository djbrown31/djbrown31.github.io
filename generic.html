				<p> "I love You" ❤️

					There is a much greater motivation than simply my spoken words. ❤️ ❤️ ❤️

					For me to love, is to commit myself, freely and without reservation. I am sincerely interested in
					your happiness and well being. Whatever your needs are, I will try to fulfill them and will bend in
					my values depending on the importance of your need. If you are lonely and need me, I will be there.
					❤️ ❤️ ❤️
					If in that loneliness you need to talk, I will listen. If you need to listen, I will talk. If you
					need the strength of human touch, I will touch you. If you need to be held, I will hold you. I will
					lie naked in body with you if that be your need. If you need fulfillment of the flesh, I will give
					you that also, but only through my love.
					❤️ ❤️ ❤️
					I will try to be constant with you so that you will understand the core of my personality and from
					that understanding you can gain strength and security that I am acting as me. I may falter with my
					moods. I may project, at times, a strangeness that is alien to you which may bewilder or frighten
					you. There will be times when you question my motives. But because people are never constant and are
					as changeable as the seasons, I will try to build up within you a faith in my fundamental attitude
					and show you that my inconsistency is only for the moment and not a lasting part of me. I will show
					you love now. Each and every day, for each day is a lifetime. Every day we live, we learn more how
					to love. I will not defer my love nor neglect it, for if I wait until tomorrow, tomorrow never
					comes. It is like a cloud in the sky, passing by. They always do, you know!
					❤️ ❤️ ❤️
					If I give you kindness and understanding, then I will receive your faith. If I give hate and
					dishonesty, I will receive your distrust. If I give you fear and am afraid, you will become afraid
					and fear me. I will give to you what I need to receive.
					❤️ ❤️ ❤️
					The degree of love I give is determined by my own capability. My capability is determined by the
					environment of my past existence and my understanding of love, truth and God. My understanding is
					determined by my parents, friends, places I have lived and been. Each experience is fed into my mind
					from living.
					❤️ ❤️ ❤️
					I will give you as much love as I can. If you show me how to give more, then I will give more. I can
					only give as much as you need to receive or allow me to give. If you receive all I can give, then my
					love is endless and fulfilled. If you receive a portion (part) of my love, then I will give others
					the balance I am capable of giving. I must give all that I have, being what I am.
					❤️ ❤️ ❤️
					Love is universal. Love is the movement of life. I have loved a boy, a girl, my parents, art,
					nature. All things in life I find beautiful. No human being or society has the right to condemn any
					kind of love I feel or my way of expressing it, if I am sincere; sincerity being the honest
					realization of myself without hurt or pain for my life or any life my life touches.
					❤️ ❤️ ❤️
					I want to become a truly loving spirit. Let my words, if I must speak, become the restoration of
					your soul. But when speech is silent, does a man project the great depth of his sensitivity. When I
					touch you, or kiss you, or hold you, I am saying a thousand words.
					❤️ ❤️ ❤️
